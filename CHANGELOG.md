ðŸš€ go-discover v1.0.0 â€“ Official Release ðŸŽ‰

Weâ€™re excited to announce the v1.0.0 release of go-discover! This marks the first feature-complete and stable version of the package.

With this release, we are officially committing to Semantic Versioning (SemVer). This means:
  - v1.0.0 signals a stable API that you can depend on.
  - Any future breaking changes will result in a major version bump.
  - Minor and patch releases will include enhancements and fixes, respectively.

Starting from this release, weâ€™ll also be maintaining detailed changelogs to help you track whatâ€™s new, improved, or changed in every update.

Thanks to everyone who contributed, tested, or provided feedback along the way. Weâ€™re looking forward to building on this solid foundation together.
